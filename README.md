This project is an interactive skill and career recommendation system designed specifically for rural youth. By entering basic personal details such as age, education level, skills/interests, and location, users receive personalized suggestions for relevant career paths or skill development courses available locally. The model uses machine learning algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) to analyze similar profiles and generate tailored recommendations.
